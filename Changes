 - Dep on version 4.101540 of Dist::Zilla::Role::ConfigDumper. ( This
   should reduce some test failures due to 'around dump_config' ) 

0.01005020 2010-07-30T09:06:26Z
 - Skip 'perl' automatically when found in modules list. Can't depend on
   perl.pm.

   warn when its run on a machine with no uname support and not publish
   uname data.
 - Added dump_config reporting support for MetaConfig

0.01000216 2010-06-13T05:07:31Z
 - Added a very overkill MetaData::BuiltWith::All module for those with
   suicidal tendencies.

 [00 Major]
 - Moderately sized packaging changes, a few small code changes.

 [01 Tooling]
 - Now uses ExtUtils::MakeMaker for installer.
 - "Latest" dependency logic now only added to /recommends/

 [02 Versioning]
 - Version scheme is now x.yyyyyy ( mantissa = 6 )
 - This is the primary reason for the 1.x on the box.

 [Bugfix]
 - BuiltWith::All ocasionally messed up when it found certain modules in %INC which had names such that it was
   impossible to load them ( Anon classes, Mx Types ), and these needlessly caused failures. Fixed.

 [00_Note]

0.02000000 2012-02-27T03:48:01Z
 [Bugfixes]
 - This release should hopefully neuter the occasional glitch that occured due to $_ being clobbered in a few places
   yeilding a package of 'undef', which emits broken META.yml. Hopefully this should resolve rt#63930

          Finally fixed that pesky \n in the uname string.
          Moral of the story:  $/ is actually evil.
            ( Thanks to Apocalypse for prodding me into finally fixing this )

          Replaced $] with { %{$^V} } to see the native version object
          instead of this deprecated string.

          Dep on version 4.101540 of Dist::Zilla::Role::ConfigDumper.
          ( This should reduce some test failures due to 'around dump_config' ) 

0.01005020 2010-07-30T09:06:26Z
          Skip 'perl' automatically when found in modules list. Can't depend on perl.pm.
          Added 'uname' reporting feature. This should mostly work still, and only warn when its run
            on a machine with no uname support and not publish uname data.
          Added dump_config reporting support for MetaConfig

0.01000216 2010-06-13T05:07:31Z

          Added a very overkill MetaData::BuiltWith::All module for those
          with suicidal tendencies.

0.01000022 2010-06-11T11:48:14Z

          First version.

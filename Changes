0.01005122 2010-07-31 23:43:00 Pacific/Auckland
          Dep on version 4.101540 of Dist::Zilla::Role::ConfigDumper.
          ( This should reduce some test failures due to 'around dump_config' ) 

0.01005020 2010-07-30 21:06:26 Pacific/Auckland
          Skip 'perl' automatically when found in modules list. Can't depend on perl.pm.
          Added 'uname' reporting feature. This should mostly work still, and only warn when its run
            on a machine with no uname support and not publish uname data.
          Added dump_config reporting support for MetaConfig

0.01000216 2010-06-13 17:07:31 Pacific/Auckland

          Added a very overkill MetaData::BuiltWith::All module for those
          with suicidal tendencies.

0.01000022 2010-06-11 23:48:14 Pacific/Auckland

          First version.

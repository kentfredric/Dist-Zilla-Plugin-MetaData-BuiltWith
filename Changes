0.02000000 2012-02-27T03:48:01Z
 [Bugfixes]
 - This release should hopefully neuter the occasional glitch that occured
   due to $_ being clobbered in a few places yeilding a package of 'undef',
   which emits broken META.yml. Hopefully this should resolve rt#63930

 - Used MooseX::Types instead of simple stringy ones.
 - Used Recent Moose traits to provide flattening instead of Autobox.
 - include and exclude are now _include and _exclude with init_args to keep
   construction the same. new methods include and exclude are 'elements'
   accessors.

 - Finally fixed that pesky \n in the uname string.

   prodding me into finally fixing this )

 - Dep on version 4.101540 of Dist::Zilla::Role::ConfigDumper. ( This

 - Skip 'perl' automatically when found in modules list. Can't depend on
   perl.pm.

   uname data.
 - Added dump_config reporting support for MetaConfig

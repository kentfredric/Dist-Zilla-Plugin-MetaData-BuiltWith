NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaData::BuiltWith - Report what versions of
    things your distribution was built against

VERSION
    version 0.04000000

SYNOPSIS
      [MetaData::BuiltWith]
      include = Some::Module::Thats::Not::In::Preq
      exclude = Some::Module::Youre::Ashamed::Of
      show_uname = 1           ; default is 0
      show_config = 1          ; default is 0
      uname_call = uname        ; the default
      uname_args = -s -r -m -p  ; the default is -a

DESCRIPTION
    Often, distribution authors get module dependencies wrong. So in such
    cases, its handy to be able to see what version of various packages they
    built with.

    Some would prefer to demand everyone install the same version as they
    did, but that's also not always necessary.

    Hopefully, the existence of the metadata provided by this module will
    help users on their end machines make intelligent choices about what
    modules to install in the event of a problem.

OPTIONS
  exclude
    Specify modules to exclude from version reporting

        exclude = Foo
        exclude = Bar

  include
    Specify additional modules to include the version of

        include = Foo
        include = Bar

  show_config
    Report "interesting" values from %Config::Config

        show_config = 1 ; Boolean

  show_uname
    Report the output from "uname"

        show_uname = 1 ; Boolean

  uname_call
    Specify what the system "uname" function is called

        uname_call = uname ; String

  uname_args
    Specify arguments passed to the "uname" call.

        uname_args = -a ; String

METHODS
  mvp_multivalue_args
    This module can take, as parameters, any volume of 'exclude' or
    'include' arguments.

  metadata
    This module scrapes together the name of all modules that exist in the
    ""Prereqs"" section that Dist::Zilla collects, and then works out what
    version of things you have, applies the various include/exclude rules,
    and ships that data back to Dist::Zilla via this method. See
    "Dist::Zilla"'s "MetaProvider" role for more details.

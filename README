Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaData::BuiltWith

Often, distribution authors get module dependencies wrong. So in such
cases, its handy to be able to see what version of various packages they
built with.

Some would prefer to demand everyone install the same version as they
did, but that's also not always necessary.

Hopefully, the existence of the metadata provided by this module will
help users on their end machines make intelligent choices about what
modules to install in the event of a problem.
